# CHICKFLIX-MOVIES

In this project follow along with me as I build a front-end Netflix clone with a Firebase back-end! We use the TMDB API for all of the data AND we will be using Firebase Authentication to give login functionality. We will be able to store user specific data with a React front-end and a Firebase back-end. We use Firestore which is cloud storage with Firebase to save data. The front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS - an incredible CSS framework to save time styling your apps. At the end of the build we deploy this LIVE with Firebase hosting.
